# Cyber Attack Classification and Clustering

## Abstract
The project aims to classify cyber-attacks in network traffic using various classification and clustering algorithms. Different algorithms will be applied and compared to identify the best one for the task.

## Introduction
With the increasing number of cyber-attacks, timely detection and classification are essential to prevent and mitigate damage. This project applies classification and clustering algorithms to classify cyber-attacks in network traffic.

## Problem Formulation
Identify effective classification and clustering algorithms for detecting and classifying cyber-attacks in network traffic data.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess network traffic data
- Identify relevant features for classification
- Apply different classification algorithms
- Compare and analyze results
- Draw conclusions and make recommendations

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset.txt:** Contains network traffic data.
- **Attack_types.txt:** Summarizes possible attack types.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Data cleaning
2. Feature selection
3. Data normalization
4. Handling categorical variables
5. Splitting and balancing the dataset

## Classification and Clustering Algorithms
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means

## Comparison and Performance Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion matrix

## Conclusions
Algorithm performance varies depending on the type and complexity of cyber-attacks. Consider various metrics and factors for algorithm selection.
